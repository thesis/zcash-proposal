Who we are
==========

[Thesis](https://thesis.co) is a cryptocurrency venture production studio. We
build products and protocols to support and protect

* Self-sovereignty
* Privacy as a human right
* Opt-in culture

Portfolio
---------

We've built a portfolio of cryptocurrency projects, backed by major investors
in the space.

1) [Fold](https://foldapp.com), an online and in-store payments and rewards
   app originally launched in 2015.
2) [Keep](https://keep.network), a data confidentiality platform for Ethereum.
   Keep enables off-chain stakers to provide provable sMPC services to smart
   contracts on the EVM.
3) [tBTC](https://tbtc.network), a bonded Bitcoin sidechain built on Keep and
   Ethereum.

We'd like to add Zcash to that list, further developing and supporting the
chain and ecosystem as a major dev fee recipient.

Our vision for Zcash
====================

Our capabilities
================

Over the years, we've developed core competencies applicable to the Zcash
ecosystem.

1) Engineering — our experienced team of software engineers have built popular
   applications and infrastructure in and outside the cryptocurrency space. In
   addition to our portfolio, we've built multi-currency wallets and traditional
   and cryptocurrency payment infrastructure, contributed widely to open-source,
   and shipped to prod at Silicon Valley powerhouses.

2) Design — our design team works across the spectrum. For live examples of our
   portfolio of visual, interaction, and UX design, check out
   [ln.pizza](https://ln.pizza), [Fold](https://foldapp.com),
   [My First Bitcoin Pizza](http://myfirstbitcoinpizza.com), and the visual
   identities of [Keep](https://keep.network/) and [tBTC](https://tbtc.network).

3) Dev/Ops — our engineering team has strong operational experience. We follow
   a declarative approach to infrastructure-as-code, automating testing and
   integration heavily for a good developer experience.

   In our experience, this is often overlooked in the cryptocurrency space.
   Strong tooling and cross-client testing means easier onboarding for
   developers looking to build on Zcash.

4) Legal — we've invested to make legal a core competency, involving legal
   feedback early to inform product decisions, while gating guidance to control
   costs.

5) Business development — rather than rely heavily on marketing, we've focused
   on the network we've built in the space, growing relationships and strategic
   partnerships.

Thesis is a full-stack cryptocurrency studio, but we do have some weaknesses.

* Research. Our team implements cryptographic papers and does minor
  translational research, but we prefer to partner with researchers rather than
  produce novel research in-house.
* Marketing. While we run growth campaigns for the products we launch and
  maintain, we're still formalizing our marketing efforts. We wouldn't be a
  strong pick to directly market Zcash, instead growing the ecosystem through
  products, partnerships, and infrastructure improvements.
